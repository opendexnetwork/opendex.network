### Community Call \#17 \(2021-03-03\) 👉 [NO Video, sorry!]() 👈

In this community call we covered [the continued institutional flow into Bitcoin](https://mailchi.mp/bytetree/bitcoin-institutional-flows-are-a-game-changer), [the new major geth 1.10 release](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.10.0) which dramatically speeds up accessing ethereum state (out of experience we can't recommend to upgrade just yet though), [another improvement proposal for a BIP70 successor](https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2021/03/03/), [I2P (an alternative to Tor) support in Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/20685) ([here](https://geti2p.net/en/comparison/tor) you can learn more about the differences between I2P and Tor), the [RGB MyCitadel iOS App 🌈](https://github.com/mycitadel/mycitadel-node) (get a basic overview of RGB [here](https://www.rgbfaq.com/faq), but as promised we'll cover RGB in greater detail in next week's call and finally saw the [new update feature of the OpenDEX Desktop App](https://github.com/opendexnetwork/opendex-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0-testnet.10) and went through how arbitrage incentivizes liquidity providers to offer liquidity on the OpenDEX network, how it works in practice and why leveraging arbitrage with CEXes to incentivize liquidity provision on OpenDEX is only really possible because of instant finality of trades. Apologies for the missing recording, we'll have a backup recording next week ✌️

### Community Call \#16 \(2021-02-24\) 👉 [Video](https://youtu.be/zpwiZlbRRbs) 👈

In this community call we covered the last piece of the puzzle missing for taproot activation on bitcoin: [LOT=true vs. LOT=false](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/lottrue-or-lotfalse-this-is-the-last-hurdle-before-taproot-activation), [the new lnd 0.12.1 release](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.12.1-beta) which fixes a nasty crash, a demo of the new setup flow in our latest [OpenDEX Desktop App Testnet release](https://github.com/opendexnetwork/opendex-desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0-testnet.7) and saw a pretty cool demo of an upcoming feature for Boltz, which not only makes it compatibly with virtually all mobile ethereum wallets, but also doesn't require you to hold ETH to do swaps with an ERC20 asset like USDT! You can already try it out at [testnet.boltz.exchange](https://testnet.boltz.exchange/) - dope! 🌿

In this community call we announced our move from "Exchange Union" to ["OpenDEX"](https://opendex.network), which unifies everything under one name and should avoid confusion down the road. This also comes with a change in product focus, how we are funded, team members and more. The gist is: we are shifting focus towards UX & end-user facing trading products while keeping our core atomic-swap-DNA \(the user is always in control of funds\) & OpenDEX will become even more open going forward. If you are interested in day-to-day updates and what we are working on, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aS5RMchDrU) and _watch_ our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/opendexnetwork). We also touched on [Microstrategy sharing the "Bitcoin for Corporations"](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit) playbook, [Elon on Clubhouse](https://twitter.com/MMCrypto/status/1356131319424704513?s=09) & Bisq's new ["Cash by Mail"](https://bisq.wiki/Cash_by_mail) feature.

In this community call, we talked extensively about `r/wallstreetbets` amazing coup against wallstreet causing hedge funds getting liquidated for their overleveraged short positions on [GameStop's stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME), that the response of "trading restrictions" of AmeriTrade & others has to lead to decentralized trading networks like OpenDEX to take off, Bitcoin as treasury for non-profits and the new releases of lnd & connext. Finally, we saw a demo of a feature-complete Trading view in XUD UI.

### Community Call \#11 \(2021-01-13\) 👉 [Video](https://youtu.be/CpeFQqFKksg) 👈

In this community call, we laughed hard at ECB's Christina Lagarde's call for a global Bitcoin regulation because of the ["funny business" conducted](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-ecb/ecbs-lagarde-calls-for-regulating-bitcoins-funny-business-idUSKBN29I1B1), how we can learn from [Wasabi's fallback mechanisms preventing being impacted by the recent attack on Tor Consensus](https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/wasabi-wallet-tor-consensus/) and touched on an open PR [removing all remaining JSON encoding from the OpenDEX protocol](https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/pull/2061#pullrequestreview-567439995) moving everything cleanly to protobuf.

We also have seen a demo of the upcoming 1.2.0 XUD UI release \(and heard a range of excuses why it's taking so long, but also some decent commitment to deliver until next week\).
