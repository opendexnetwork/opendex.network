# BOLD #4: Swap Protocol

## Overview

Once an order match is found in the taker’s order book, the swap protocol should be initiated. The current swap protocol assumes that the taker and maker are connected via a payment channel network (e.g. the [Lightning](http://lightning.network/) or [Raiden Network](https://raiden.network/)) with sufficient balance available for the swap. The following is the swap protocol's "happy" flow:

1. Matcher finds a match, e.g. 1 BTC for 10k DAI 
2. Matcher sends the `SwapRequest` message to the taker and maker
3. Taker creates the private `r_preimage` and the public `r_hash` for the atomic swap
4. Taker sends the `SwapAccepted` message to the maker and matcher, which includes `r_hash`. Or if he unaccept trade he send swapFailed
5. Maker sends `SwapAccepted` message to matcher and taker.
6. Taker starts the swap by dispatching the first-leg HTLCs on the DAI payment channel to the maker end, using `r_hash`
7. Maker is listening for an incoming HTLC on the DAI payment channel. Once it arrives he verifies price and quantity and then dispatches the second-leg HTLCs on the BTC payment channel to the taker end.
8. Taker is listening for an incoming HTLC on the BTC payment channel. Once it arrives he releases `r_preimage`. This allows **both** the taker and the maker payments to finalize.
9. Taker sends the `SwapCompleted` message to the maker and matcher

Possible misbehaviors and their outcome:

| Misbehavior                                                                        | Outcome                                               | Effect on payment channels 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Owner of order doesn't respond to the `SwapRequest` message from matcher                                 | Swap should be timeouted and matcher and other party of trade should penalize peer that didn't respond  | None                                                       |
| Taker doesn't start the swap after receiving the `SwapAccepted` message             | Maker should timeout the swap and penalize the taker  | None                                                       |
| Maker receives the first-leg HTLC with insufficient amount or incorrect CLTV delta  | Maker should send the taker a `SwapError` message   | Taker funds are locked until HTLC expiration               |
| Maker doesn't continue the swap after receiving the first-leg HTLC                  | Taker should timeout the swap and penalize the maker  | Taker funds are locked until HTLC expiration               |
| Taker receives the second-leg HTLC with insufficient amount or incorrect CLTV delta | Taker should sends the maker a `SwapError` message  | Both Taker and Maker funds are locked until HTLC expiration|
| Taker doesn't release `r_preimage` after receiving the second-leg HTLC              | Maker should timeout the swap and penalize the taker  | Both Taker and Maker funds are locked until HTLC expiration|
| Taker doesn't send the `SwapCompleted` message after releasing `r_preimage`         | None; swap has already finalized                      | None                                                       |
## Swap Protocol
### SwapRequest Message (0x0c)

	`string id = 1`
	The message's globally unique identifier, generated by the sender 

    `uint64 proposed_quantity = 2`
    The proposed quantity

    `string pair_id = 3`
    The trading pair for the swap

    `string order_id = 4`
    The unique identifier of the maker order

    	

The `SwapRequest` message is sent by the matcher to the taker and the maker to start the swap negotiation. 

### SwapAccepted Message (0x0d)

    `string id = 1`
	The message's globally unique identifier, generated by the sender 
	
    `uint64 req_id = 2`
    The id from the received SwapRequest message

	`string r_hash = 3`
    The taker’s preimage hash (in hex) from the received SwapRequest message

	`string quantity = 4`
	The accepted quantity (which may be less than the proposed quantity)

	`uint32 maker_cltv_delta = 5`
    The CLTV delta from the current height that should be used to set the timelock for the final hop when sending to the maker.

The `SwapAccepted` message is sent by either side of the swap protocol to other side and matcher to accept the swap request.

### SwapComplete Message (0x0e)

	`string id = 1`
	The message's globally unique identifier, generated by the sender 

	`string r_hash = 2`
    The taker preimage hash (in hex)

The `SwapComplete` message is sent by the taker and the maker to each other and matcher to announce the successful completion of the swap

### SwapFailed Message (0x0f)

	`string id = 1`
	The message's globally unique identifier, generated by the sender 

    `uint64 req_id = 2`
    An optional id from the received SwapRequest message. Otherwise, this field is empty

	`string r_hash = 3`
	The taker’s preimage hash (in hex)

	`string error_message = 4`
	Additional information regarding the failure reason

	`uint32 failure_reason = 5`
	The failure reason

The `SwapFailed` message can be sent by either side of the swap protocol to other side and matcher, at any time, to announce the swap termination.

`failure_reason` is an optional parameter for specifying the failure reason:
