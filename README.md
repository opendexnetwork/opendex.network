**OpenDEX is a layer 3 cross-chain DEX built on the [Lightning](https://lightning.network/) and [Connext](https://connext.network/) networks.** OpenDEX consists of software, community and an open protocol standard with the goal to unify currently incompatible protocols and fragmented liquidity onto one network.
